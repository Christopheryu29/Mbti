# Troubleshooting Guide - Why Data Isn't Posting

## ‚úÖ What I Just Fixed

### Issue 1: API URL Not Configured for Production
**Problem:** Frontend was hardcoded to use `http://localhost:3001/api` even on Vercel
**Solution:** Updated `src/config/env.ts` to auto-detect the correct API URL based on environment

### Issue 2: Wrong API Endpoint Paths
**Problem:** API routes had `/api` prefix when they shouldn't (Vercel routing adds it automatically)
**Solution:** Changed routes from `/api/process-order` to `/process-order` in `api/index.js`

### Issue 3: Missing CORS Preflight
**Problem:** Browser might send OPTIONS request before POST
**Solution:** Added OPTIONS handler for CORS preflight requests

### Issue 4: No Error Logging
**Problem:** Hard to debug when things fail
**Solution:** Added comprehensive console logging throughout the API

## üîç How to Debug on Vercel

### 1. Check Function Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click **Deployments** ‚Üí Select latest deployment
3. Click **Functions** tab
4. Click on `/api/index` to see logs
5. Look for error messages

### 2. Check Environment Variables
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. Verify ALL 10 variables are set:
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY (with quotes and \n)
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID
   - ‚úÖ GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID
   - ‚úÖ CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   - ‚úÖ CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   - ‚úÖ CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

### 3. Test API Endpoint Directly
After deployment, test your API using curl:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_DOMAIN with your Vercel domain
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN.vercel.app/api/process-order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "address": "123 Test St",
    "personalityType": "INTJ",
    "template": "middle",
    "position": "",
    "paymentImage": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+M9QDwADhgGAWjR9awAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fileId": "mbti-payments/payment_1234567890",
  "webViewLink": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "rowNumber": 1
}
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to get access token"
**Cause:** Google credentials not properly configured
**Solution:**
1. Check `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` has quotes and `\n` characters
2. Verify service account email has access to the Google Sheet
3. Share your Google Sheet with: `mbti-639@mbti-474907.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### Issue: "Cloudinary upload failed"
**Cause:** Cloudinary credentials missing or incorrect
**Solution:**
1. Verify all 3 Cloudinary variables are set correctly
2. Check Cloudinary dashboard for API limits

### Issue: "File not found" for Google Sheets
**Cause:** Service account doesn't have access to the sheet
**Solution:**
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click "Share"
3. Add `mbti-639@mbti-474907.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with Editor access

### Issue: API returns 404
**Cause:** Vercel routing not configured correctly
**Solution:**
1. Make sure `vercel.json` exists with correct rewrites
2. Redeploy after making changes

### Issue: CORS errors in browser console
**Cause:** API not allowing cross-origin requests
**Solution:** Already fixed - API now handles CORS properly

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before testing on production:

1. ‚úÖ All 10 environment variables added to Vercel
2. ‚úÖ Google Sheet shared with service account email
3. ‚úÖ Cloudinary account has available uploads
4. ‚úÖ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
5. ‚úÖ Vercel deployed successfully
6. ‚úÖ No build errors in Vercel logs

---

## üìä Expected Flow

When a user submits a payment:

1. **Frontend** (`Payment.tsx`)
   - User selects image
   - Clicks "NEXT"
   - Shows "Preparing order data..."

2. **API Service** (`apiService.ts`)
   - Converts image to base64
   - POSTs to `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/api/process-order`
   - Shows "Processing order..."

3. **Vercel Function** (`api/index.js`)
   - Receives POST request
   - Validates data
   - Uploads to Cloudinary ‚Üí Gets URL
   - Saves to Google Sheets ‚Üí Gets row number
   - Returns success response

4. **Frontend** (`Payment.tsx`)
   - Receives success
   - Shows "Order processed successfully!"
   - Navigates to success page

## üîß What Changed in Code

### File: `src/config/env.ts`
```typescript
// Auto-detects API URL:
// - Production: uses https://yourdomain.vercel.app/api
// - Development: uses http://localhost:3001/api
```

### File: `api/index.js`
- ‚úÖ Removed `/api` prefix from routes
- ‚úÖ Added OPTIONS handler for CORS
- ‚úÖ Added detailed logging
- ‚úÖ Added better error messages

### File: `src/services/apiService.ts`
- ‚úÖ Already converts images to base64 (previously fixed)

## üìû Still Not Working?

If it's still not working after these fixes:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs** (most important!)
   - Go to Deployments ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí `/api/index`
   - Look for the error messages I added

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for network errors or failed requests

3. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   node server-example.mjs

   # Terminal 2: Start frontend
   npm run dev

   # Test the upload - should work locally if env vars are set
   ```

4. **Verify the test script**
   ```bash
   node test-integrations.js
   ```
   All tests should pass except Google Drive

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix API routing and add debugging"
   git push
   ```

2. **Wait for Vercel to deploy** (auto-deploys on push)

3. **Check deployment logs** for any errors

4. **Test the upload** on your deployed site

5. **Check Vercel Function logs** to see what's happening

6. **Verify data appears** in your Google Sheet

---

## ‚ú® Summary

The main issues were:
1. ‚ùå API URL was pointing to localhost in production
2. ‚ùå API routes had wrong paths for Vercel
3. ‚ùå Missing CORS preflight handling

All fixed now! After deploying, check the Vercel Function logs to see exactly what's happening.
